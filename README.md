### Tool used: SQL

-	The database was designed to represent a DVD rental store in early 2005.
-	Applied advanced SQL queries, such as the 'JOIN' function, to connect six tables and utilized 'window functions' to rank the performance of staff in SQL.
-	Analyzed sales data for rental volumes and monthly rental volumes, evaluated inventory levels by creating reports with film names and categories; assessed revenue from payments by month and each store, identifying unpopular movies for potential sale.
